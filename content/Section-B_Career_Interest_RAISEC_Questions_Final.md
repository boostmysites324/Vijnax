(Social) • • Summary of All 60 RIASEC Career Interest Questions • Each of the 6 RIASEC categories is evenly represented across the 60 questions to ensure balance and subtle profiling: RIASEC Approx. Distribution Realistic (R) 10 questions Investigative (I) 10–11 questions Artistic (A) 10–11 questions Social (S) 10–11 questions Enterprising (E) 9–10 questions Conventional (C) 9–10 questions 1. Overview of RIASEC Interest Scoring Each question in the test has 4 options, each mapped to one of the six RIASEC types: • R – Realistic • I – Investigative • A – Artistic • S – Social • E – Enterprising • C – Conventional Across 60 questions, each RIASEC type appears ~10 times. This ensures balance. 2. Response Tracking & Score Calculation • For each student, track the number of times they choose an option corresponding to each RIASEC type. • Final output: a score out of 60 split among 6 interest types. Example: RIASEC Type Count Percentage R (Realistic) 10 16.7% -- 10 of 12 -- RIASEC Type Count Percentage I (Investigative) 12 20.0% A (Artistic) 6 10.0% S (Social) 14 23.3% E (Enterprising) 11 18.3% C (Conventional) 7 11.7% 3. Stream Mapping Matrix Based on RIASEC Scores We’ll use dominant and secondary scores to suggest the most suitable stream. A dominant RIASEC type is one that exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 20%) or ranks in the top 2 types. RIASEC-to-Stream Mapping Stream Strongly Associated RIASEC Types Science (Maths group) R, I, C Science (Biology group) I, S, C Commerce C, E, I Humanities A, S, E Vocational / Applied R, C, A 4. Recommendation Logic Primary Recommendation • Identify top 2 RIASEC scores. • Match them with predefined stream profiles. • Select the stream that aligns with both top RIASEC scores. Tie-breaking Logic If multiple streams match equally: • Use additional rules from aptitude scores (from the earlier test section) to prioritize. Sample Interpretation: If a student’s top RIASEC scores are: -- 11 of 12 -- • I = 12, S = 11, followed by C = 9 → Recommend Science (Biology group) If: • R = 12, I = 11, C = 10 → Recommend Science (Maths group) If: • E = 11, C = 10, S = 10 → Recommend Commerce If: • A = 12, S = 11, E = 10 → Recommend Humanities (or creative + leadership stream) 5. Final Report Structure Each student’s report should include: 1. RIASEC Score Table – Bar chart or radar graph 2. Top 2 Interest Types – Description in simple language 3. Suggested Stream – With explanation (Why this suits you) 4. Next Steps – Courses, entrance exams, and career paths linked to stream 5. Note – That aptitude + personality + interest all matter for final decision 6. Optional Add-ons (Advanced Features) • Stream Fit Index (0–100 score for each stream based on full profile) • Combine with aptitude section weighting for final composite recommendation • Offer 3 closest-fit streams ranked -- 12 of 12 --
