Updated Blueprint: Stream Selection Test (60 Minutes, Indian Context) Section Focus Area Type No. of Qs Time (mins) Cultural Context Mapped Streams A Cognitive Aptitude MCQ (Objective) 20 15 NTSE-type logical, numerical, and spatial reasoning PCM, PCB, Commerce B Career Interests (RIASEC- based) Subtle Likert 18 10 Lab work, teaching, managing, designing, helping others PCM (Investigative), PCB (Social/Bio), Commerce, Humanities C Personality Traits (Big Five) Mixed Likert 18 10 Social empathy, introversion, discipline, curiosity PCB (Agreeable, Empathetic), PCM (Conscientious, Inquisitive), Humanities D Decision- Making & Judgment Situational MCQ 12 10 Examples: Choosing between Biology project & Physics contest PCM vs PCB orientation; Ethical dilemmas also link to Humanities E Learning Orientation Forced Choice + Likert 12 7 Group study, private tuition, JEE/NEET coaching, etc. Matches study habits to Science streams & Commerce prep styles F EQ / Social Intelligence Situational MCQ 10 5 Family criticism, stress, peer help High EQ: PCB, Humanities; Moderate: Commerce G Work Values & Lifestyle Preferences Statement Ratings 10 3 Research career vs. high-earning jobs vs. service roles PCM (autonomy), PCB (impact), Commerce (stability), Humanities (expression) Score Calculation Process 1. Raw Scores → Sectional Percentile per Stream o Each response is tagged to a latent stream indicator o Each section’s score is normalized (0–100 scale) 2. Apply Sectional Weights o Each stream gets a weighted score from each section -- 1 of 5 -- o Formula: Stream Score = Σ (Section Score × Section Weight for that Stream) 3. Final Stream Scores o Total composite score for each stream out of 100 o Example Output (for a sample student): Stream Composite Score (out of 100) PCM 82 PCB 58 Commerce 49 Humanities 45 4. Recommendation Logic: o Primary Stream: Highest score ≥ 70 → Strong recommendation o Secondary Stream: Score between 60–69 → Alternate suggestion o Below 50: Not recommended o Integrated: No stream > 60 but multiple streams around 55–59 → multidisciplinary suggestion with guidance notes Sample Interpretation Table (Sectional Scores) Section PCM PCB Commerce Humanities Aptitude (out of 40) 32 21 28 17 Interests (out of 20) 14 17 15 19 Personality (out of 10) 7 9 6 8 Decision-Making (out of 10) 8 6 6 7 Learning Style (out of 5) 3 4 3 3 EQ (out of 5) 2 4 2 4 Work Values (out of 10) 7 3 9 7 Total 73 64 69 65 Recommendation: Primary – PCM | Secondary – Commerce | Tertiary – PCB Additional Considerations -- 2 of 5 -- • Flag conflicts: e.g., high interest in PCM but low aptitude → advisory note • Highlight motivational drivers from work values • Emphasize personality-stream mismatch for awareness (e.g., high agreeableness in student preferring PCM) • RECOMMENDED QUESTION POOL SIZE Section Test Qs per Student Suggested Pool Size Justification Aptitude (MCQ) 20 160 questions Ensure 8 unique sets with >90% variation; covers difficulty tiers Interest Inventory (Likert) 18 120 statements Many-to-one mapping possible; avoids pattern repetition Personality Traits (Likert) 18 108 statements 3+ variations per trait (Big Five); prevents overfamiliarity Decision-Making & Judgment (MCQ) 12 90 scenarios 3 variants per ethical/dilemma type; subtle, student-relevant Learning Orientation (MCQ/Likert) 12 60 items Study behavior has limited variants, but needs rotation Emotional & Social Intelligence (MCQ) 10 60 situations EQ responses must remain fresh to avoid gaming Work Values & Preferences (Rating) 10 50 items Values are fewer but nuanced; rotate for engagement STRUCTURE OF QUESTION POOLS (Summary): Section Total Pool Per Test Type Streams Mapped Aptitude 160 40 MCQ PCM, PCB, Commerce, Humanities Career Interests (RIASEC) 108 54 MCQ All streams (multiple tagging) Personality Traits (Big Five) 108 54 MCQ Trait-based mapping Decision Making & Judgment 90 30 MCQ All streams Learning Orientation 60 24 Mixed All streams Emotional & Social Intelligence 60 24 MCQ All streams Work Values & Preferences 36 18 MCQ All streams CHALLENGES IN RANDOM SELECTION 1. Maintaining subtheme balance within sections (e.g., Big Five traits, RIASEC types) 2. Avoiding repetition for retest users -- 3 of 5 -- 3. Avoiding pattern detection (option-to-stream logic rotates) 4. Ensuring equal stream-relevance in each test set RECOMMENDED SELECTION LOGIC 1. Tag-based Categorization Each question in the master pool is tagged with: • Section • Subtheme (e.g., "Conscientiousness", "Investigative") • Stream Tags (for scoring) • Question ID 2. Fixed Subtheme Quotas per Test Define how many questions to draw per subtheme. Example (Aptitude): • Numerical Reasoning: 10 • Spatial: 6 • Logical: 6 • Verbal: 6 • Puzzle/Critical Thinking: 6 • Attention/Speed: 6 This ensures balance. 3. Random Sampling Within Quotas Use code or a backend logic to: • Shuffle the pool within each subtheme • Randomly select required count (e.g., random.sample() in Python) 4. Rotation by Option Tag Map To prevent students from identifying stream tags through option positions (e.g., “A always means PCM”), rotate the option-to-stream tagging using multiple patterns — already embedded in your spreadsheet. 5. Session-specific Fingerprinting (Optional Advanced) Track the question IDs served in each session using a session token. This helps avoid repeats if a student retakes the test. FINAL ALGORITHM FLOW (Simplified) -- 4 of 5 -- 1. Input: Student ID → Generate Session Token 2. For Each Section: o Retrieve question pool o Filter by subtheme quotas o Shuffle and select required number o Apply tagging pattern for this session (rotate from a fixed set) 3. Serve Questions to frontend 4. Capture Answers + Tag Scores 5. Aggregate per Section → Normalize scores → Stream recommendations Technical Output (Per Session) Each session should output: • session\_id • question\_ids\_served • selected\_options • tag\_to\_stream\_map\_used • section\_scores • overall stream recommendation -- 5 of 5 --
