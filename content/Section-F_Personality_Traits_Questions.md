(Agreeableness) D) Speak out about it. (Extraversion) Q108. I feel most alive when: A) I’m thinking deeply or imagining. (Openness) B) I’m achieving what I planned. (Conscientiousness) C) I’m connecting with others meaningfully. (Agreeableness) D) I’m performing or leading. (Extraversion) Here is the trait-based scoring logic and stream recommendation framework for the Big Five Personality Traits section (based on 108 multiple-choice questions): Step 1: Trait Tagging (per Question Option) Each of the 108 questions has 4 options, and each option is tagged to one of the Big Five traits: • C – Conscientiousness (discipline, planning, focus) • O – Openness (curiosity, abstract thinking, creativity) • A – Agreeableness (empathy, kindness, supportiveness) • E – Extraversion (confidence, talkativeness, sociability) • S – Emotional Stability (handling pressure, mental calm) • L – Low Stability (worry-prone, anxious) – reverse scored Questions with “Low Stability” (L) options are reverse scored – selecting those reduces stability points. Step 2: Scoring Logic • For each question: o Assign +1 to the trait associated with the chosen option. o If the option is tagged “L” (Low Stability), subtract 1 from Stability. o Each trait will accumulate a raw score out of a theoretical maximum (usually ~20–30 depending on how many questions mapped to it). Step 3: Stream Mapping Rules (Based on Personality) -- 18 of 20 -- Trait Combination Stream Recommendation Why? High Conscientiousness + High Openness PCM (Maths group in Science) Disciplined + Curious = Strong fit for analytical, abstract thinking streams like engineering, math, and physics High Agreeableness + High Empathy PCB (Biology group in Science) Caring + observant = Ideal for medical, life sciences, psychology High Openness + High Agreeableness Humanities / Social Sciences Reflective + people-oriented = Strong fit for philosophy, history, literature, sociology High Extraversion + Moderate Openness/Agreeableness Commerce Social + practical = Business, entrepreneurship, marketing- friendly disposition High Emotional Stability Boosts reliability of any stream match Ensures stress-handling ability in demanding careers Low Conscientiousness or Low Stability Flag for possible counseling recommendation May indicate poor coping or planning abilities Each recommendation will be accompanied by trait-wise scores and brief guidance to the student on why a particular stream fits them. Step 4: Decision Thresholds (Customizable) • Normalize each trait score to a scale of 10 or 100. • Apply a decision matrix such as: o PCM: C > 7, O > 7 o PCB: A > 7, C > 6, S > 6 o Humanities: O > 7, A > 6 o Commerce: E > 7, C > 6 or O > 6 These thresholds are tunable after some pilot testing with real student data. -- 19 of 20 -- Sample\_Student\_Trait\_Score\_Report Trait Raw Score (out of 25) Normalized Score (out of 10) Conscientiousness 21 8.4 Openness 19 7.6 Agreeableness 17 6.8 Extraversion 14 5.6 Emotional Stability 23 9.2 Here is a sample narrative report based on the scores you see in the table: Student Report Name: A.
